Attending the Future & Options trading event of Growcial Bulls Academy was an excellent decision for me. The event
provided a comprehensive overview of trading strategies and techniques specific to futures
and options markets. The speaker, Mr. Vikas Chaudhary was knowledgeable and engaging, and I was able to
gain valuable insights into the markets and trading strategies. I left the event feeling more
confident in my ability to navigate these markets and make informed trading decisions.
Overall, I highly recommend this event to anyone looking to improve their understanding of
futures and options trading.

, I enrolled myself into the Growcial course and till now this is the best course for Stock Market. I had tried many other courses but this course helped me to technically analyse the data and charts. Along with that, the live sessions were awesome and it even helped me to easily understand the various concepts of the Stock market which should be known. It even helped me analyse my results and the practice sessions were a lot helpful. Now I have started my Stock market journey yet again but this time with a lot of knowledge which will help me in right trading. There were many courses which I tried earlier but they focused just on learning. This course is a lot different as it focused on analysis and practical data through which I was able to analyse the resu‚Ä¶

You are a true mentor sir. You always hold my hand and always tells me to contact whenever I have a doubt, even in the live market. There are many mentors i have seen, who just care about money and once the money is credited, they don't even care about the person. You stand away from them and you are a very good person with high level of patience and a responsible one. You give your best and support all the time, irrespective of the fee. Im happy to be met a true mentor( you ) and i feel anyone can excel in their lives, if he/she finds a mentor like you.
